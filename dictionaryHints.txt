iterating over a dictionary
No method is needed to iterate over a dictionary:

for key in d:
	print key
But it's possible to use the method iterkeys():
for key in d.iterkeys():
	print key
The method itervalues() is a convenient way for iterating directly over the values:
for val in d.itervalues():
	print val
The above loop is of course equivalent to the following one:
for key in d:
	print d[key]
